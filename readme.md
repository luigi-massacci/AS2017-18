##Commits
###Prefixes:
 Since mostof you are lazy and use GitKraken, there's no point in telling you what prefix to use.
###Content:
  Keep it short and simple. But not stupid. Please.


##Code standards
 if in doubt, follow the Python Zen (import this).
###Indentation
 Indentations are made by a tab.

###Comments
Comments should respect these parameters:

+ the language used is English
+ the infinitive is preferred in order to keep things as simple as possible

The structure used to describe a function is as follows:

	/*******************************************
	* function name (possible parameters)
	* the aim of the function
	* possible values returned
	*******************************************/
